I also tested the auto-fill it looked fine.


PART TWO:
* The following tests are strong candidates for automation:

Test Case 1: Form Load

Description: Verify that the form loads correctly.
Motivation: Automating this test ensures that the form is consistently available and displayed correctly across test runs. Automated scripts can quickly verify the visibility and presence of key elements, reducing manual verification time and ensuring that any loading issues are promptly identified.

Test Case 2: All Elements to be Clickable

Description: Verify that all interactive elements on the form are clickable.
Motivation: Automating this test is crucial for ensuring that all interactive elements (buttons, dropdowns, links) function as expected. Automated tests can simulate user interactions and verify that each element behaves correctly, which is especially useful for regression testing when new features or changes are introduced.


Test Case 4: Fill in All Mandatory Fields and Captcha

Description: Verify form submission with all mandatory fields and captcha filled in.
Motivation: This test is a strong candidate for automation as it verifies the complete submission flow, including form validation and captcha. Automated tests can simulate user input, handle captcha interactions (if possible), and verify successful submission, ensuring end-to-end functionality is working correctly.


Test Case 6: Invalid Email Address

Description: Test the form with invalid email address format.
Motivation: Automating this test ensures that invalid email addresses are consistently flagged by the system. Automation can quickly validate that the error handling is working properly, and the correct error messages are displayed.

Test Case 9: Invalid Field Length of First Name Field

Description: Test the first name field with more than the recommended max length.
Motivation: Automating this test verifies that the system correctly enforces field length constraints. Automated tests can help ensure that such validation errors are detected and handled gracefully, reducing the risk of unexpected behavior or user-facing issues.

Important note: Captcha is tricky to be automated. One of the workarounds to test this should be using test environments where CAPTCHA is disabled.
